Book Summary: 30 Days: Change Your Habits, Change Your Life: A Couple of Simple Steps Every Day to Create the Life You Want


Chapter#1
Remember: You are leading the life that you have chosen! How? This is because
we create our life every moment through our thoughts, beliefs, and expectations
and our mind is so powerful that it will give us what we ask for. The good thing
is that you can train your mind to give you only the things you want, and not the
things that you don’t want! And it gets even better: you can learn how to deal
with things that you can’t control in a more efficient and less painful manner.

Your happiness depends of YOU, and nobody else!

Simply reading the book won’t help you a lot, though. You have to take
ACTION!

You have to start doing and practicing the exercises and introducing new habits into your life.

It doesn’t matter what happened in your past. Your future is a clean sheet!

Every day brings with it the opportunity to start a
new life! You get to choose your identity at each and every moment! So who are
you going to be? It’s up to you to decide who you are going to be from this day
on. What are you going to do?

In 2008, when FC Barcelona’s coach Josep “Pep” Guardiola said:
“We can’t promise you titles, what we can promise you is effort and that
we will persist, persist, persist until the end. Fasten your seatbelts - we are going
to have fun”

Make some effort and persist, persist, persist! Don’t give up! Fasten your seatbelts and have some fun!
