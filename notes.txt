Book Summary: 30 Days: Change Your Habits, Change Your Life: A Couple of Simple Steps
 Every Day to Create the Life You Want


Chapter#1
Remember: You are leading the life that you have chosen! How? This is because
we create our life every moment through our thoughts, beliefs, and expectations
and our mind is so powerful that it will give us what we ask for. The good thing
is that you can train your mind to give you only the things you want, and not the
things that you don’t want! And it gets even better: you can learn how to deal
with things that you can’t control in a more efficient and less painful manner.

Your happiness depends of YOU, and nobody else!

Simply reading the book won’t help you a lot, though. You have to take
ACTION!

You have to start doing and practicing the exercises and introducing new habits into your life.

It doesn’t matter what happened in your past. Your future is a clean sheet!

Every day brings with it the opportunity to start a
new life! You get to choose your identity at each and every moment! So who are
you going to be? It’s up to you to decide who you are going to be from this day
on. What are you going to do?

In 2008, when FC Barcelona’s coach Josep “Pep” Guardiola said:
“We can’t promise you titles, what we can promise you is effort and that
we will persist, persist, persist until the end. Fasten your seatbelts - we are going
to have fun”

Make some effort and persist, persist, persist! Don’t give up! Fasten your seatbelts
and have some fun!

Chapter 2: Self-Discipline and Commitment

“It was character that got us out of bed, commitment that moved us into action
and discipline that enabled us to follow through.” -Zig Ziglar

“If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way.” -Napoleon Hill

"Self discipline is doing the things you need to do, even if you are not in the mood
for it"
These will keep you going towards your goals even when everything seems to go against you.
Your way to success and happiness is deeply connected to your willpower and commitment.

Self-discipline is like a muscle.
The more you train it, the better you get. If your self-discipline is weak right
now, start training it by setting yourself small, reachable goals. Write down the
success you have and keep in mind that you don't have limits - only the ones you
set for yourself.

Think for the reward not for the difficulty:
For example if you want to go running at 6 a.m. in the morning and you 
just don't seem to make it out of bed - imagine how good you will feel when you are at the fitness level
that you want to be at and how great you will look. Then jump out of bed, put on
your running clothes, and go! 

Take your commitments seriously beacuse if you won't follow your commitments then it'll hurt
your self-confidence, self-esteem....

Time to take action!
Ask yourself the following questions:
In what areas are you lacking self-discipline at the moment? Be completely
honest.
What benefits will you obtain if you had more self-discipline?
What will be your first step towards reaching your goal?
Write down your plan of action in small steps. Give yourself deadlines.
How will you know you've reached your goal of having more self-discipline in
_______?

Chapter 3: Take full responsibility for your life!
“Peak performance begins with your taking complete responsibility for your life
and everything that happens to you.” -Brian Tracy

"Most people do not really want freedom, because freedom involves
responsibility, and most people are frightened of responsibility.” -Sigmund Freud

There is only one person that's responsible for your life and that is YOU!
Not your boss, not your spouse, not your parents, not your friends, not your clients,
not the economy, not the weather. YOU!

The day we stop blaming others for everything that happens in our life, everything changes! 
It doesn’t matter what happens to you in your life; it matters what attitude you adopt.

Stop reacting to others and start responding. Reaction is automatic. Responding is consciously 
choosing your response.

If you are not part of the problem, then you also can’t be a
part of the solution , so think that "this or that failure is occured because you've done something wrong".

Gandhi said it very nicely: “They can’t take away our self-respect if we don’t give it to them.”

Ask yourself the following questions: Who are you blaming for your life
situation right now? (Your partner? Your boss? Your parents? Your friends?)
What would happen if you stopped blaming the others for what happens to you
in your life?

What would happen if you stopped suffering in your life and took the decision to
change it?

Action Step:
Write down five things that you can do in the coming week to start changing the
course and start taking charge of your life.

Chapter 4: Choices and Decisions
Maybe you have heard that your life is the result of the decisions you made.
Every decision, every choice has an important influence on your life. In fact,
your life is a direct result of the choices and decisions you made in the past and
every choice carries a consequence! Start making better choices.
Remember that you choose your thoughts and even your feelings.

The most important thing is to make decisions. Whether the decision is right or
wrong is secondary. You will soon receive feedback that will help you to
progress. Once you have made a decision, go with it and take the consequences.
If it was wrong, learn from it and forgive yourself knowing that at that point in
time and with the knowledge you had, it was the best and the right decision to
take.

YOUR ATTITUDE + YOUR DECISIONS = YOUR LIFE

But if you can't control the circumstances then there is one thing that you can control
and that is your attitude or response to what had happened to you
It was you who CHOSE HOW these circumstances were going to affect him!

Do you want to be healthier? Make better choices about food and exercise. Do you want to 
be more successful? Make better decisions about who you surround yourself with, 
what you read, and what you watch. There are no excuses!

Chapter 5: Choose your thoughts
"You are today where your thoughts have brought you; you will be tomorrow
where your thoughts take you.” -James Allen

If you want to improve your life, the first thing you have to do is improve your
thoughts
By controlling your thoughts, ultimately you control your life
Peace Pilgrim‘s quote 
“If you realized how powerful your thoughts are, you would never think a negative
thought.” 
So don’t get stuck in negative thoughts. 
Replace them with positive thoughts every single time they come up 
such as “everything is going to be all right” 

Train your mind to concentrate only on positive, creative,
and inspiring thoughts. I

THOUGHT creates EMOTION creates BEHAVIOR creates ACTION.

Your thoughts depend on your beliefs about life. If you don’t like what you are
receiving then have a look at what you are sending! Everything that is in your
life has been created by your thoughts, expectations, and beliefs. So analyze
them! If you change your beliefs, you will get new results!

Action Step:
Try to have no negative thoughts for 48 hours. Block them from the first
moment and substitute them with positive thoughts of love, peace, and
compassion. Even if it seems difficult at the beginning, hang in there. It gets
easier. Then try this for 5 days, and finally a week. What has changed in your
life since you started thinking positively?

=============================================================================

Chapter 6: What do you believe?
your beliefs influence your emotions, your emotions influence your actions and your
actions influence your RESULTS! 

I want you to realize that life doesn’t just happen to you! It’s a reflection of
your beliefs, thoughts, and expectations. If you want to change your life you
have to first change your patterns of thinking.

Henry Ford said! If you think that you won’t make it, if you think that it’s impossible, 
then you will not
achieve it even if your effort is huge

For many decades it was thought impossible that man could run a mile under four minutes. 
There were even scientific papers and studies on the subject. 
These studies could all be shredded on May 6th 1954, when Roger Bannister proved 
everybody wrong at a race in Oxford. From then on over a 1000 people have done it.

Stop having these beliefs:
• Life is tough.
• Showing emotions is for weak people.
• Opportunity only knocks once.
• I’m helpless and have no control over my life.
• I don’t deserve it.
• Nobody loves me.
• I can’t.
• It’s impossible.
________________________________________

And pick up some empowering beliefs such as: 
• I create my destiny.
• Nobody can hurt me if I don’t allow it.
• Life is great!
• Everything happens for a reason.
• Everything is going to be all right.
• I can do it!
________________________________________

Action Step:
1) Write down the limiting belief.
2) Remember the sequence: belief – emotion – action – result.
3) To get a different result – in what way do you need to act?
4) How do you need to feel in order to act differently and get a different
result?
5) What do you need to believe in order to feel differently, act differently,
and get a different result?

Chapter 7: The Importance of your Attitude

Life is made up of laughter and tears, light
and shadow. You have to accept the bad moments by changing your way of
looking at them. Everything that happens to you is a challenge and an
opportunity at the same time.
Look at the positive side of things in life even in the worst situations. There is
something good hidden in every bad – although sometimes it might take some
time to discover it.

“If life gives you a lemon, add sugar to it, and make lemonade out of it”.

Action Step:
Think of a negative situation and turn it around.
